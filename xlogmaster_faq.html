<H2><A NAME="SEC2" HREF="xlogmaster_faq_toc.html#TOC2">1.1. Preface</A></H2>

<P>
This is the introduction to a list of frequently asked questions (FAQ's)
about the Xlogmaster with answers.  This article contains a listing of the
questions; subsequent articles contain the questions and answers.

</P>
<P>
If you know the answer of a question is in the FAQ list, please reply to
the question by e-mail instead of posting.  Help reduce noise!

</P>
<P>
Please suggest new questions, answers, wording changes, deletions, etc.
The most helpful form for suggestions is a context diff (i.e. the output
of <SAMP>`diff -c'</SAMP>).  Include <SAMP>`FAQ'</SAMP> in the subject of messages sent
to me about the FAQ list.

</P>
<P>
Please do not send questions to me just because you do not want to
disturb a lot of people and you think I would know the answer.  I do
not have time to answer questions individually and keep up with
everything else I have to get done. Questions to me that have been
answered before slow down development and that is bad for everyone.

</P>



<H2><A NAME="SEC3" HREF="xlogmaster_faq_toc.html#TOC3">1.2. What is the Xlogmaster ?</A></H2>

<P>
The Xlogmaster is a GTK+ (see the GIMP tookit page under
http://www.gimp.org/ for more information) based program that helps you
to monitor all kinds of system activity. It allows monitoring and
background surveillance of all logfiles and devices that allow being
read by <CODE>cat</CODE> like the <TT>`/proc'</TT> devices. You can configure the
Xlogmaster graphically to take almost any action you can think of upon
certain events and it can certainly help you keeping track of everything
and increasing system security.

</P>

the tutorial that should be in your info tree. Otherwise you can find it
in the <TT>`doc'</TT> directory of the distribution
<DT>*
<DD>
the manpage.
<DT>*
<DD>
executing the Xlogmaster via <CODE>xlogmaster --help</CODE>

<H2><A NAME="SEC8" HREF="xlogmaster_faq_toc.html#TOC8">2.1. Normal installation</A></H2>

<P>
Normal installation is done by unpacking the archive and then entering
it. <CODE>./configure ; make ; make install</CODE> should do everything
then. The default is to install it into the <TT>`/usr/local'</TT>
structure. If you want to change that and for other configuration
options, please see <CODE>./configure --help</CODE>.

</P>



<H2><A NAME="SEC9" HREF="xlogmaster_faq_toc.html#TOC9">2.2. Make doesn't seem to understand the Makefiles</A></H2>

<P>
This can happen on some systems (especiall SunOS or old Solaris ones) --
the problem is easily fixed by using <CODE>gmake</CODE> instead of <CODE>make</CODE>.
