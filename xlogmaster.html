<H2><A NAME="Whatis" HREF="#TOCWhatis">What is the Xlogmaster ?</A></H2>

<P> If you are in a hurry, here is the ultra-short version:<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><EM>
The Xlogmaster is a program that lets you monitor everything that's going on
on your system in a very quick and comfortable way. It allows reading logfiles,
devices or running status-gathering programs, translating all data (if wished)
and displaying it with filters for highlithing / lowlighting / hiding lines or taking
actions upon user-defined events.
</EM></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
For those who'd like to know more, here is an introduction into the features:
<P>
Based on the standard UN*X commands that perform similar tasks the modes are called
<UL>
<LI><B>TAIL-Mode:</B> 
The Xlogmaster will read the file and then check back in
regular intervals (default: 0.3 seconds) whether anything has changed -
practically the same functionality you got with "tail -f" but just much
nicer to handle and look at. If you monitor more than two logfiles it makes
things much easier already.
</LI>
<LI><B>CAT-Mode:</B> 
This mode keeps on "catting" the file/device you have
given it in user defined intervals. The first thing that will probably come 
to your mind now is: "Cool ! I can keep track of all the /proc devices that 
are of interest for me." (didn't it ? :-) ) Whatever - I really like this mode.</LI>
</UL>
and
<UL>
<LI><B>RUN-Mode:</B> 
The run mode allows starting a program and retrieving it's stdout. This allows you
to write a shellscript/program to gather any data that's important for you and
monitor the output in the Xlogmaster - with all the features the Xlogmaster has.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>

The retrieved information may then be piped through a <B>plugin</B> - the plugins
take the data on stdin and output it to stdout which is being read by the Xlogmaster
again. This enables you to translate cryptic logfiles or extracting information in 
a special way.

<P>

After reading the data from the TAIL/CAT/RUN modes (and piping it through the plugin
if wished) it can then be processed in certain ways. The
obvious one is displaying it in the text window. To make this more comfortable you can
define filters that allow you to raise, lower or hide lines on a extended REGEX
match.

<P>

Since version 1.3.0 the Xlogmaster supports background monitoring, as well - 
you can define
filters that trigger certain actions based on a case-insensitive substring match. 
The entry does not need to be active for that.

<P>

I invented a classification for these filters to make clear 
they work on different levels. The <B>Class0 filters</B>
are filters that are applied at <B>display-time</B> and the 
<B>Class1 filters</B> are used in the background.
Implemented filters are:

<UL>
<EM>All matches are extended REGEX matches. See GNU REGEX manual for reference.</EM><P>
<LI> <B> CLASS0: </B> only one of the Class0 filters can be applied on a line. Usually the first applicable match is
being taken. The only exception is "Hide" - if it can be applied the line will be hidden even if it also matches
another Class0 filter.</LI>
<UL>
<LI> <B> Raise: </B> a line is being highlighted on a match </LI>
<LI> <B> Lower: </B> a line is being lowlighted on a match </LI>
<LI> <B> Hide: </B> a line is being hidden on a match </LI>
</UL>
<LI> <B> CLASS1: </B> all of the Class1 filters than can be applied are being applied so theoretically a single
line can trigger all filters and maybe even several times. All Class1 filters also trigger a user chosen
sound when being triggered so the user also gets an audio-warning.</LI>
<UL>
<LI> <B> Alert: </B> the button for the logfile flashes up in a user-defined color (default is red) and slowly
fades back to it's normal color within a given timespan. The idea is that occurences that are only of interest
for a certain timespan don't trigger the buttons to be all red if you leave the keyboard for a few hours.</LI>
<LI> <B> Notice: </B> a notice box will pop up at the current mouse position showing you the name of the
entry and the line that triggered the alarm together with the date the notice has been triggered. The notice box
contains a list so nothing will get lost. The box will be cleared and disappear if you click on the "dismiss" button
 - but only then, so events that were very important will always be brought to your notice even if you have
been afk for days.</LI>
<LI> <B> Uniconify: </B> the Xlogmaster will uniconify automatically if this event is being triggered. Useful for
people with limited desktop space who prefer to keep the Xlogmaster iconified.</LI>
<LI> <B> Execute: </B> a user-given program is being executed on a match. Some useful default scripts are
contained in the distribution but you can easily write your own ones, as well. For this purpose the Xlogmaster
supplies some variables (name of entry, helptext for entry, line that triggered execution, absolute path to file/device, mode of entry (TAIL/CAT)).</LI>
</LI>
</UL>
</UL>


<H2><A NAME="New" HREF="#TOCNew">What's new in the current release ?</A></H2>

<H2><A NAME="Platforms" HREF="#TOCPlatforms">Supported Platforms</A></H2>

First of all: You will <EM>definitely</EM> need the 
<A HREF="http://www.gtk.org/">GTK+</A> toolkit version 1.2.x if you didn't install 
it already. 
Apart from that there is no reason why it shouldn't work on all UN*X systems. Until
now I did not receive any mail telling me that the Xlogmaster did not install fine.
<P>
The following list shows all systems I have positive knowledge about from users
who told me they got the Xlogmaster running without major problems. If your system  
is not on the  list and you are successful with the installation I'd like you 
to send a short mail to  <A HREF="mailto:xlogmaster-bugs@gnu.org">
<EM>xlogmaster-bugs@gnu.org</EM></A>
 so I can include your system in this list. <UL>
<LI> AIX 4.1.5 </LI>
<LI> Digital UNIX 3.2c </LI>
<LI> FreeBSD </LI>
<LI> GNU/Linux </LI>
<LI> HP-UX </LI>
<LI> Irix5.3 (MIPS R4000) </LI>
<LI> Irix 6.2 (MIPS R5000) </LI>
<LI> Solaris </LI>
<LI> SunOS 4.1.1 </LI>
<LI> x86 BSDI 3.0 </LI>
<LI> ... ? </LI>
</UL>

<H3><A NAME="Ports" HREF="#TOCPorts">Existing Ports</A></H3>
For some systems people already configured the Xlogmaster package to fit
the system/distribution best. If you are running one of those systems you might
consider installing the ported version instead of the original one because it will probably
be even easier to install and will cause the Xlogmaster to be installed "the standard way"
for your system without you having to worry about it. Ports exist for the following systems:<UL>


<LI> <A HREF="http://www.freebsd.org/ports/index.html">FreeBSD</A> </LI>
<LI> <A HREF="http://www.debian.org/">Debian GNU/Linux</A> - packages for:
<A HREF="http://www.debian.org/Packages/stable/admin/xlogmaster.html">

</LI>

</UL>

If you happen to maintain a port for a system not on this list you can send me a mail with
the HTML address (text preferred but I can include FTP addresses in case there is nothing 
else available) to
<A HREF="mailto:xlogmaster-bugs@gnu.org"><EM>xlogmaster-bugs@gnu.org</EM></A>
and I will include it here.<P>

<H2><A NAME="Obtaining" HREF="#TOCObtaining">Obtaining the Xlogmaster</A></H2>

You can download the Xlogmaster from the gnu.org FTP site at <A HREF="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/">ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/</A> or one of it's mirrors. <P>

Additionally you should be able to find it on <A HREF="ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/gnu/">ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/gnu/</A> or one of it's mirrors. <P>

If everything fails there are still my private Xlogmaster pages at <A HREF="http://www.fusebox.hanse.de/xlogmaster/">http://www.fusebox.hanse.de/xlogmaster/</A> or <A HREF="http://porter.desy.de/~greve/xlogmaster/">http://porter.desy.de/~greve/xlogmaster/</A>. <P>

For "still hot and steaming" development versions fresh out of the running development you might want to
check out the <A HREF="/software/xlogmaster/development.html">development page</A>.

<P>If you would like to know whether someone already configured the package to fit your
system best you should take a look at the <A HREF="#Ports">Existing Ports</A> list.

<P> Also see the <A HREF="/software/software.html#HowToGetSoftware">software</A>

<H2><A NAME="Help" HREF="#TOCHelp">Getting Help with the Xlogmaster</A></H2>

If you have a question about the Xlogmaster in general, about help for including it in
some project or distribution you can send a mail to <A HREF="mailto:xlogmaster-bugs@gnu.org">xlogmaster-bugs@gnu.org</A>. 
If the question has been answered in the tutorial, the manpage or on this 
page, though, the answer
will most probably contain several R's, T's, F's and M's.<P> 

<P>Information on getting help with GNU software in general is available
at the <A HREF="/help/gethelp.html">Get Help with GNU Software</A> page. </P>
