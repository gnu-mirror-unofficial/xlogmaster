The first version of Xlogmaster was written in 1996, using the XVIEW toolkit. 
Georg didn't like that toolkit too much so it all ended up in
a pretty messy piece of code that was only compile-time configurable and
not very stable -- Georg did use it for two years, though, always telling
himself "I'll be writing a clean version soon".
<P>
June 1998 Georg finally managed to actually keep this promise and completely
rewrote the Xlogmaster for the GTK+ toolkit (see 
<TT>`http://www.gtk.org/'</TT>). First Georg only intended to write it for
his private usage but when he recieved a lot of feedback from
people around the world he decided to make the Xlogmaster a real and
regular project. With version 1.4.0 Xlogmaster then became an
official GNU program.
<P>
Xlogmaster will allow you to monitor all your logfiles and all
devices that allow being read by <CODE>cat</CODE>. Furthermore it supplies
several filters that will do things from raising/hiding lines in the
text display to starting programs to send you a paging message about a
possible security breach.
<P>
If used wisely Xlogmaster can make it very easy to keep track of
everything that happens on your system and it can increase your systems
security by quite a lot. This program has been written and published in
the hope that it will prove useful to you but I do 
<EM> not guarantee for anything</EM> but my best will.

</P>



<H1><A NAME="SEC3" HREF="tutorial_toc.html#TOC3">How to use Xlogmaster</A></H1>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX3"></A>

</P>
<P>
Xlogmaster runtime usage is basically pretty simple. There is a
button on the side for each entry and as you might have guessed clicking
on the button will make the Xlogmaster display that entry.
<P>
There are more functions that are less obvious:

</P>

<PRE><CODE>right mouse button</CODE> will bring up the menu.

<CODE>middle mouse button</CODE> will toggle whether the buttons are being
shown/hidden.

<CODE>left mouse button</CODE> will pick the standard selection (for
cut&#38;paste).

</PRE>

<P>
these do only work in the <EM>text window</EM>, though.
<P>
Apart from that you can use the cursor-keys to move the standard
selection around and activate it by hitting <KBD>RET</KBD>.
<P>
The configuration should be self explanatory, if you keep the mouse
pointer over an object a small help window will pop up.

</P>



<H1><A NAME="SEC4" HREF="tutorial_toc.html#TOC4">Internal workings of Xlogmaster</A></H1>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX4"></A>

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC5" HREF="tutorial_toc.html#TOC5">Modes</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX5"></A>

</P>
<P>
Xlogmaster knows basically two modes of operation, the 
<EM>tail mode</EM> and the <EM>cat mode</EM>. Both modes are named after the
programs they emulate.

</P>
<P>
For both modes you can give an interval -- this is the time (in 1/10
seconds) between two calls of the interrupt function. This interval
directly  determines how often Xlogmaster checks for changes in the
logfile (<EM>tail mode</EM>) or how often it replaces the data in the
buffer with the current data (<EM>cat mode</EM>).

</P>



<H3><A NAME="SEC6" HREF="tutorial_toc.html#TOC6">Tail mode</A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX6"></A>
The <EM>tail</EM> mode basically works like using <CODE>tail -f</CODE> on a
logfile. It will read a file and then keep on reading whatever gets
appended to it over time. Xlogmaster should also be able to catch
logfile rotations so you don't have to reopen it every time the logfiles
have been rotated.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="SEC7" HREF="tutorial_toc.html#TOC7">Cat mode</A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX7"></A>
The <EM>cat</EM> mode works like doing a <CODE>cat &#60;filename&#62;</CODE> so it reads
the whole file every time. This is necessary for reading things like
the <TT>`/proc'</TT> devices.

</P>



<H2><A NAME="SEC8" HREF="tutorial_toc.html#TOC8">Filters</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX8"></A>

</P>
<P>
Xlogmaster has two classes of filters, enumerated <EM>Class 0</EM> and
<EM>Class 1</EM> filters. The main difference is that the <EM>Class 0</EM>
filters are filters being applied at <EM>display time</EM> while the
<EM>Class 1</EM> filters are being applied at <EM>read-time</EM>.<BR>
Matching for the filters is <EM>always</EM> done per line -- patterns
that would match more than one line will <EM>never</EM> match anything !
<P>
The following filters are known:

</P>



<H3><A NAME="SEC9" HREF="tutorial_toc.html#TOC9">Class 0 filters</A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX9"></A>
As mentioned before <EM>Class 0</EM> filters are being applied at
<EM>display-time</EM> -- if a line triggered multiple filters <B>only</B>
the one with the highest priority is being applied ! 

</P>
<P>
The filters are (from highest to lowest priority):

</P>



<H4><A NAME="SEC10" HREF="tutorial_toc.html#TOC10">Hide</A></H4>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX10"></A>
Lines that trigger this action will be hidden without paying attention
whether the line triggered other <EM>Class 0</EM> filters or not. Lines
that do trigger any of these will be displayed the usual way.

</P>


<H4><A NAME="SEC11" HREF="tutorial_toc.html#TOC11">Raise</A></H4>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX11"></A>
Lines that triggered this acton will be raised (highlighted) without
paying attention whether they also triggered a <EM>Lower</EM> action.

</P>



<H4><A NAME="SEC12" HREF="tutorial_toc.html#TOC12">Lower</A></H4>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX12"></A>
Lines that triggered this action will be lowered (lowlighted).

</P>



<H3><A NAME="SEC13" HREF="tutorial_toc.html#TOC13">Class 1 filters</A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX13"></A>
<EM>Class 1</EM> filters are being applied at <EM>read-time</EM>  ---
logfiles with <EM>Class 1</EM> filters are being watched in the
background, the filters will do exactly the same thing regardless of
whether you are just looking at that logfile or not.

</P>
<P>
The <EM>Class 1</EM> filters will be triggered for each line they can be
applied on, but each filter only once (even if the string would
theoretically match multiple times). They do <STRONG>not</STRONG> exclude each
other, though. Each filter that can be applied will be applied !

</P>



<H4><A NAME="SEC14" HREF="tutorial_toc.html#TOC14">Alert</A></H4>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX14"></A>
The button of the entry that triggered the alert will flash in the
<EM>alert color</EM> and then slowly fades back
to it's normal color. The <EM>alert color</EM>, the time it takes to fade
back and the smoothness of the fading can be controlled at
<EM>configure-time</EM> as well as <EM>runtime</EM>.

</P>
<P>
The purpose of this filter is to inform you of events that are of
interest right now but become less important over time -- the fading
back prevents a situation that you come back to your machine and find
all the buttons in <EM>alert color</EM> additionally you get an impression
of how recent the alert was if you catch it while fading back.

</P>


<H4><A NAME="SEC15" HREF="tutorial_toc.html#TOC15">Execute</A></H4>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX15"></A>

</P>
<P>
This filter allows you to start programs and/or scripts when a certain
string shows up. This is potentially the most powerful of the
filters. Your program gets it's information via environment variables or
via commandline. The following variables / environment variables are
known:
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><SAMP>`%F'</SAMP>
<DD>
<DT><SAMP>`XLM_FILENAME'</SAMP>
<DD>
absoute path to file/device of entry.
<DT><SAMP>`%H'</SAMP>
<DD>
<DT><SAMP>`XLM_HELP'</SAMP>
<DD>
helptext of entry.
<DT><SAMP>`%L'</SAMP>
<DD>
<DT><SAMP>`XLM_LINE'</SAMP>
<DD>
line that actually triggered the Execute filter.
<DT><SAMP>`%M'</SAMP>
<DD>
<DT><SAMP>`XLM_MODE'</SAMP>
<DD>
mode of entry.
<DT><SAMP>`%N'</SAMP>
<DD>
<DT><SAMP>`XLM_NAME'</SAMP>
<DD>
name of the Logfile that triggered the Execute filter.
</DL>
<P>
A word of warning: the execute entry will only process one command
and substitute the variables accordingly. If you want to create a more
complicated setup I'd recommend to write a small shellscript. This
especially means that piping will <EM>not</EM> work.

</P>


<H4><A NAME="SEC16" HREF="tutorial_toc.html#TOC16">Notice</A></H4>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX16"></A>

</P>
<P>
This filter has been implemented for events that are of extreme
importance regardless of when they have been triggered. A notice box
is being popped up at the current mouse position. This notice box
contains a list with the time and date of the triggering action as well
as the name of the entry that triggered it. If you click on an entry in
this list you'll see the triggering line in the text field below the list.
<BR>
If you set <SAMP>`--notice-follows-mouse'</SAMP> at startup the notice box will
move to the current mouse position every time something new has been
added.

</P>


<H4><A NAME="SEC17" HREF="tutorial_toc.html#TOC17">Uniconify</A></H4>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX17"></A>

</P>
<P>
For people who like to keep Xlogmaster iconifed because of space
shortage. If you set this filter Xlogmaster will uniconify automatically
when a matching line has been seen.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC18" HREF="tutorial_toc.html#TOC18">Audio Support</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX18"></A>

</P>
<P>
The Xlogmaster has Open Sound System (OSS) support. For every
<EM>Class 1</EM> filter type (the only exception being execute) you can
define a sound that gets played whenever this filter type has been
triggered.
<BR>
The requirements that the sounds have to meet are simple: They need to
be playable via <CODE>cat &#60;soundfile&#62; &#62; /dev/dsp</CODE>. This usually means
they should be about 8KHz and in a standard format (<SAMP>`Wave'</SAMP>,
<SAMP>`ULaw'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`SUN audio'</SAMP> for instance).
<BR>
Please check out the commandline options for setting of the
soundfiles. If nothing is given Xlogmaster will use the files in
<TT>`$prefix/etc/sound'</TT>. The standard is to play back the files
called <TT>`notice'</TT>, <TT>`alert'</TT> or <TT>`uniconify'</TT> -- I'd recommend
to make then symbolic links instead of actually copying the files there.

</P>
<P>
There are two different filetypes used for configuration by Xlogmaster. 
One is the GTK+ special style file, the <STRONG>gtkrc</STRONG> file I do not want
to say too much about that one because it is documented with the GTK+
toolkit 
(See Info file `GTK', node `Resource Files')
and it's format is actually pretty simple. A look at
the sample files distributed along with Xlogmaster should already
solve all questions, so feel free to check them out and try around with
them. They allow you to control the look of Xlogmaster any way you
want and it's definitely worth risking a look.
<P>
Xlogmaster internal configuration file is pure ASCII and can hence
be processed easily with any text editor although you will most probably
not need to do so because the customization menu is much nicer.
<P>

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC21" HREF="tutorial_toc.html#TOC21">Xlogmaster configuration file format</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX21"></A>

</P>
<P>
The format is line oriented, this means every entry needs to use exactly
one line. Entries that do not follow this policy will be ignored.
<BR>
There are two kinds of entries for the configuration file, the first is
a line that contains the <STRONG>mode</STRONG> of the entry along with it's name
and some more information. The format for this kind of entry is
<P>
<SAMP>`MODE{FILENAME,INTERVAL,BUTTONTEXT,HELPTEXT}'</SAMP>
<P>
where the fields are the same as in the customization menu:
<BR>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><SAMP>`MODE'</SAMP>
<DD>
The mode for the entry
(See see section <A HREF="tutorial.html#SEC5">Modes</A>)
, either <STRONG>TAIL</STRONG> or <STRONG>CAT</STRONG>
<DT><SAMP>`FILENAME'</SAMP>
<DD>
The absolute path to the file or device that the entry is for.
<DT><SAMP>`INTERVAL'</SAMP>
<DD>
The interval (in tenth of seconds) for this entry.
(See see section <A HREF="tutorial.html#SEC5">Modes</A>)
<DT><SAMP>`BUTTONTEXT'</SAMP>
<DD>
The name to appear on the button for the entry.
<DT><SAMP>`HELPTEXT'</SAMP>
<DD>
The text that should pop up when the mouse pointer has been pending over
the button for a short while.
</DL>
<P>
The second kind of entry is the one for the filters. A filter line looks
like
<P>
<SAMP>`MODES{REGEX}'</SAMP>
<P>
the <SAMP>`MODES'</SAMP> are a comma separated list of filter modes (only one
<EM>Class 0</EM> filter is allowed) and the <SAMP>`REGEX'</SAMP> is a standard
regular expression (see GNU Regex manual). The filter lines always apply
to the
<P>
Available strings for the <SAMP>`MODES'</SAMP> are
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><SAMP>`RAISE'</SAMP>
<DD>
A display-time filter.
(See see section <A HREF="tutorial.html#SEC9">Class 0 filters</A>)
<DT><SAMP>`LOWER'</SAMP>
<DD>
A display-time filter.
(See see section <A HREF="tutorial.html#SEC9">Class 0 filters</A>)
<DT><SAMP>`HIDE'</SAMP>
<DD>
A display-time filter.
(See see section <A HREF="tutorial.html#SEC9">Class 0 filters</A>)
<DT><SAMP>`NOTICE'</SAMP>
<DD>
A background filter.
(See see section <A HREF="tutorial.html#SEC13">Class 1 filters</A>)
<DT><SAMP>`ALERT'</SAMP>
<DD>
A background filter.
(See see section <A HREF="tutorial.html#SEC13">Class 1 filters</A>)
<DT><SAMP>`UNICONIFY'</SAMP>
<DD>
A background filter.
(See see section <A HREF="tutorial.html#SEC13">Class 1 filters</A>)
<DT><SAMP>`EXECUTE'</SAMP>
<DD>
A background filter.
(See see section <A HREF="tutorial.html#SEC13">Class 1 filters</A>)
This filter requires another argument -- the commandline that will be
executed when a line matches the <EM>REGEX</EM>. The commandline is just
appended in <SAMP>`{   }'</SAMP> brackets.
(See see section <A HREF="tutorial.html#SEC15">Execute</A>)
<DT><SAMP>`INVERT'</SAMP>
<DD>
invert sense of matching -- all non-matching lines will trigger a
filter
<DT><SAMP>`CASE_SENSITIVE'</SAMP>
<DD>
matching is performed case sensitive
</DL>
